<h2>About</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  This is a website for Tuottajamarket.fi, where there's a landing page, a web shop
  and a shopping cart functionality. This was created for the Taitaja2024 Web Design
  semifinal. The website supports both desktop & mobile usage. Unfortunately the
  website is not on the root of the web server so I had to figure out the base url
  based on how many directories we're from root when defining links and paths.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  The user can navigate to the web shop and browse different products, the products
  can be filtered by category. In the future the user should also be able to put products
  in the shopping cart and make orders, but I didn't manage to do that in time.
